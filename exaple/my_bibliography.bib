   abstract = {This essay aims to analyze the conception of a work of art in the thought of Susanne K. Langer. The author offers us a definition of art, grounded on the idea that art is the “creation of symbolic forms of human feeling”. This thesis is, in turn, constructed from a robust theory of the symbolic function of the human mind.},

@article{Fokt2017,
   abstract = {Most modern definitions of art fail to successfully address the issue of the ever-changing nature of art, and rarely even attempt to provide an account that would be valid in more than just the modern Western context. This article develops a new theory that preserves the advantages of its predecessors, solves or avoids their problems, and has a scope wide enough to account for art of different times and cultures. It argues that an object is art in a given context iff some person(s) culturally competent in this context have afforded it the status of a candidate for appreciation for reasons considered good in this context. This weakly institutional view is supplemented by auxiliary definitions explaining the notions of cultural contexts, competence, and good reasons for affording the status. The relativisation to contexts brings increased explanatory power and scope, and the ability to account for the diversity of art.},

@article{Bartel2021,
   abstract = {Traditional monist theories of art fail to account for the diversity of objects that intuitively strike many as belonging to the category art. Some today argue that the solution to this problem requires the adoption of some version of pluralism to account for the diversity of art. We examine one recent attempt, which holds that the correct account of art must recognize the plurality of concepts of art. However, we criticize this account of concept pluralism as being unable to offer an explanation of why some concept is an art concept. Instead, many of the disagreements over the definition of art could be reconciled by recognizing that works of art can be valued in a plurality of ways. By recognizing a plurality of values for art, we claim further that the definition of art becomes a non-issue.},

@inproceedings{Pares2018,
   abstract = {This paper describes a new solid-state, zero propellant, radio-frequency (RF) resonant, variable near field reactants and Variable Electromagnetic Drive, (VEM Drive). The VEM Drive creates a pulling action within the framework of general relativity which states any type of matter or energy bends spacetime. The authors demonstrate how it is possible to create a pulling force in front of the VEM Drive. The data collected shows an artificial inducement to compress local space. Laboratory investigations and preliminary findings confirm the hypothesis that the resultant VEM Drive pulling force is accomplished using fractal tri-pole electromagnetic fields, which can adjust the near field reactants along with a throttle control and a 48 Vdc, 160 Ah battery pack. The pulling-to-power results at 20 seconds of continuous power are 0.19 N at 100 W to 6.25 N at 1650 W for the VEM Drive. A further comparison will be made between other Ion and EM Drives.},

@article{HerreraMelo2019,
   abstract = {En este trabajo se polemiza con los periodos institucionalizados por la historia de la teorización filosófica sobre la ciencia, al mismo tiempo que son expuestos. También se describen las cuatro familias de teorías de la ciencia propuestas por el Materialismo Gnoseológico de Gustavo Bueno y dentro de una de ellas, el circularismo, se postula a la Teoría del Cierre Categorial como el ejemplar más sobresaliente.  Finalmente, se explica cómo la arquitectura, el dinamismo y la potencia de la Teoría del Cierre Categorial representan la superación radical de todas las teorías de la ciencia predecesoras. Este trabajo pretende constituirse como un recurso bibliográfico indispensable para que el público Hispanoamericano, poco familiarizado con el Materialismo Filosófico, pueda acercase teoría de la ciencia que de él se deriva.  },
